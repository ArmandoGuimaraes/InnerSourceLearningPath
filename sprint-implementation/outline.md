        - Structure of CONTRIBUTING.md
        - Examples of great CONTRIBUTING.md files
- Optional but highly valuable automation
    - Remove whitespace discussions from your code reviews - use linters
    - Implement pre-commit hooks to ensure your tests run before PR is submitted

### Contribution prerequisites
- General contribution guidelines
    - TC - establish rules for your team
        - Decide who does PR reviews and how long can a contributor wait for the review
        - Decide who supports contributors (see next section)
        - Decide when you need a design review prior to accepting pull requests (Request for Change practice)
    - TC - establish rules for contributors and spell them out in CONTRIBUTING.md - see prior section
    - Contributors - learn your area of work
        - Take time to learn the system you will contribute to
        - Review the host team requirements - their coding standards may differ from yours, even if you work in the same framework/language
- How to organize your backlog
    - When contribution is more than one story
        - How to deal with large changes requested by the Contributor's team
        - What to do if their change has downstream effect
    - The importance of acceptance criteria
    - Indications of Contributor's commitment
    - Managing dependencies

### Sprint Planning
- TC - establish Contributor's point of contact
    - Their responsibilities
    - Communicating with Contributor
- Contributor - show up and be prepared to confirm your capacity and availability to ensure you receive optimal support

### During the Sprint
- TC - ensure that Contributor's supporter is able to prioritize the support work over team backlog
- Helpful tips for PR reviews
    - If you have to explain anything more than once - move that information into your docs
    - Apply the same diligence in reviewing your team's code as you do with external Contributors
- Contributor - help close gaps in the docs to pave the road for future contributors
    - Document what you have learned from PR reviews, if it was not available or unclear prior to the reviews
    - Submit a separate PR for documentation fix, so your change does not have additional dependencies 

### After the Sprint
- TC - remember to demo Contributor's work and recognize their contribution
    - Praise them verbally and in writing, include their peers and their manager
    - Give credit for their enhancements when reporting to your own leadership 
- Contributor - remember to thank your support and offer respectful feedback for future interactions
- Re-establish expectations for post-Production support (link to 30-day warranty pattern)
- What to do if contribution has not been completed
